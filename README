run Make in the directory

it expects /usr/include/wireshark to exist, on ubuntu aptitude install wireshark-dev

It should copy the plugin to ~/.wireshark/plugins, and then loading a wireshark packet dump should decode the packet types.

When I tested, I used a tcpdump with full packets, I'd recommend the same or things will probably break.

ex:
tcpdump -w minecraft.dump -s 0 'port 25565'

Enjoy!
